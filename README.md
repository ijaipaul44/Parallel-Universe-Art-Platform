# Quantum-Inspired Parallel Universe Art Platform

A decentralized platform that harnesses quantum mechanics principles and parallel universe theories to generate, curate, and exhibit digital art across virtual galleries. The platform uses smart contracts, NFTs, and quantum random number generators to create unique artistic experiences.

## Features

### Quantum-Inspired Art Generation
- Integration with quantum random number generators (QRNG) for true randomness in artistic creation
- Algorithmic art generation based on quantum mechanical principles like superposition and entanglement
- Parameter mapping between quantum states and visual elements

### Parallel Universe Galleries
- Multiple interconnected virtual galleries representing different "universe" states
- Cross-gallery exhibitions that showcase artwork variations across parallel timelines
- Interactive viewing experiences that allow users to traverse different artistic dimensions

### Smart Contract Integration
- Automated artwork rights management and royalty distribution
- Transparent provenance tracking for all created pieces
- Smart curation contracts for organizing and managing exhibitions
- Integration with major blockchain networks for NFT minting and trading

### NFT Implementation
- Unique tokens representing original artworks
- Special curator tokens for gallery management rights
- Exhibition tokens for participating in cross-universe shows
- Achievement tokens for successful curation and artistic milestones

## Technical Architecture

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quantum-art-platform/main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
QRNG_API_KEY=your_quantum_rng_api_key
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=ethereum_mainnet
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
IPFS_NODE=your_ipfs_node_address
```

## Usage

### For Artists

```javascript
// Connect to the platform
const quantumArt = new QuantumArtPlatform({
  apiKey: process.env.QRNG_API_KEY
});

// Generate quantum-inspired artwork
const artwork = await quantumArt.generate({
  style: "quantum-superposition",
  dimensions: [1024, 1024],
  complexity: 0.8
});

// Mint artwork as NFT
const nft = await quantumArt.mintNFT(artwork);
```

### For Curators

```javascript
// Create a new exhibition
const exhibition = await quantumArt.createExhibition({
  name: "Quantum Realities",
  universes: ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"],
  duration: "30d"
});

// Add artwork to exhibition
await exhibition.addArtwork(nft.id, {
  universe: "alpha",
  position: [0, 0, 0]
});
```
